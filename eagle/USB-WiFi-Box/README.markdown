# USB WiFi Box

A small breakout board that goes between the
[ZCN-722M](http://www.zcom.com.tw/program1/product_showtext.asp?infoid=C$cE*yQ$x&cmd=1)
WiFi modules and a USB Mini B Connector. The ZCN-722M comes with a 0.1 inch
header with USB pinout. This is brought to a USB Mini B connector for easy
use with a laptop. The stack is then set in a small steel box and RF sealed
with copper tape. This should provide plenty of RF shielding for noise floor
testing.

The Antenna line is broken out from the U.FL connector on the board to an SMA
on the side of the box via a short cable.
